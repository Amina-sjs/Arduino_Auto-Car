**Electronics and Control**
Control Board (The Brain): Arduino Uno

The main microcontroller responsible for the robot's logic and processing.

**Motor Driver: Motor Shield** (An expansion board mounted on top of the Arduino)

Responsible for controlling the speed and direction of the four motors.

**Distance Sensor (The Eyes)**: HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor

Used to measure distance to obstacles for avoidance.

**Sensor Actuator: Mini Servo Motor** 

Allows the HC-SR04 sensor to rotate and scan the surrounding area.

**Power Supply: Battery Holder / Battery Pack**

The power source for the robot's autonomous operation (the black, rectangular element).

**⚙️ Mechanics and Movement**

**Wheels and Motion: 4WD Platform** (4 Wheels)

Four gear motors (yellow) that provide drive to each wheel.

**Two-Level Platform** (Frame)

The structural base to which all components are attached.

**Mounts**

Used for mounting the Arduino board, Motor Shield, and other components.

Identification: "TECH FAIRIES" Label (Decorative Element)

The name of our team, integrated into the design.
